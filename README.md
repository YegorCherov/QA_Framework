# QA Framework

The QA Framework is a comprehensive and scalable quality assurance solution for web applications and their associated APIs. This framework provides a structured approach to testing, enabling organizations to deliver high-quality software that meets the expectations of their end-users.

## Features

1. **Web Application Testing**:
   - Automated crawling and analysis of web pages to generate test cases.
   - Functional testing for core features and user interactions.
   - Usability and responsive design testing.
   - Performance testing to ensure optimal load handling and responsiveness.
   - Security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
   - Accessibility testing to verify compliance with WCAG standards.

2. **API Testing**:
   - Automatic exploration and documentation of API endpoints.
   - Comprehensive functional testing, including positive and negative scenarios.
   - Security testing for authentication, authorization, and data integrity.
   - Performance testing to assess API throughput and response times.
   - Integration testing to validate the seamless communication between the web application and APIs.

3. **Test Automation Framework**:
   - Modular and extensible test suite for both web UI and API tests.
   - Data-driven approach to improve maintainability and scalability.
   - Seamless integration with Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines.
   - Detailed reporting and visualization of test results and coverage.

4. **Test Management and Traceability**:
   - Structured test planning and case design processes.
   - Efficient defect tracking and resolution workflows.
   - Comprehensive requirements traceability to ensure full coverage.
   - Centralized test management and collaboration capabilities.

5. **Reporting and Analytics**:
   - Detailed test reports with overall quality metrics and trend analysis.
   - Performance reports highlighting load, stress, and response time characteristics.
   - Accessibility reports evaluating compliance with WCAG standards.
   - Email-based notification and distribution of reports to stakeholders.
